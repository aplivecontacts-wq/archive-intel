# Simple Case Test — Get an A on the Instrument Panel

This is a **full manual test**: one simple case, step-by-step, so you can run through the system and see **Grade A** on the Instrument Panel.

---

## Topic

**Voyager 1 launch date** — one clear fact, lots of agreeing high-quality sources (NASA, BBC, etc.). Good for multi-ref timeline and high credibility.

---

## Step-by-step (do this in the app)

### 1. Create the case

- Open the app (e.g. http://localhost:3000), sign in, go to your cases.
- **Create a new case.**
- **Title:** `Voyager 1 launch date`
- **Objective:** `Establish the exact launch date of Voyager 1 from official or established news sources.`
- Save.

### 2. Add a query

- Open the case.
- Add a **query** (e.g. from the query panel / “Add query” or similar):
  - **Name/label:** e.g. `Voyager 1 launch 1977`
  - **Category:** Quote (or URL if you prefer).
  - **Input:** e.g. `Voyager 1 launch date September 1977`
- Run the query / search so you get results.

### 3. Save 2–3 strong sources

From **Results**, save at least **2 links** that state the launch date (e.g. NASA, BBC, Reuters, or any .gov / established news). Prefer:

- **NASA (nasa.gov)** — e.g. a Voyager mission page.
- **BBC (bbc.com)** or **Reuters (reuters.com)** — e.g. “Voyager 1 launched 5 September 1977”.

For each saved link:

- Mark **at least one** as **Primary (P)** (the P button on the saved link card).
- If one of them is an official doc or primary source, also check **Official source** (in the meta row under the link).

So you should have **2–3 saved links**, with at least one **Primary** (and optionally **Official source**).

### 4. Optional but helpful

- Add a **short note** on one saved link (e.g. “Confirms launch 5 Sept 1977”).
- On one or two links, click **Extract key facts** (and let Analyze run) so the brief has more content to cite.

### 5. Build the brief

- Open the **Case Briefs** tab/section.
- Click **Build** (or **Rebuild** if you already had a brief).
- Wait for the brief to finish generating.

### 6. Check the Instrument Panel (get an A)

- Stay on the case page and open the **Intel Dashboard** section.
- Find the **Instrument Panel** card.

You should see something like:

- **Score:** 90–100  
- **Grade:** **A**  
- **Drivers** (examples):  
  - “Strong share of official, news, or analyst-marked primary/official sources.”  
  - “Evidence themes have supporting sources.”  
  - “Minimal unresolved contradictions.”  
  - “No critical evidence gaps identified.”

**Why this gets an A:**

| Component | Why it scores well |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Credibility** | .gov (NASA) and/or established news (BBC, Reuters) + analyst-marked **Primary** (and optionally **Official source**) → high weights. |
| **Timeline** | Same fact (launch date) from 2+ saved links → the brief can attach **≥2 source refs** to timeline events → full or near-full timeline points. |
| **Contradictions** | One clear fact, agreeing sources → model outputs **0** contradictions. |
| **Critical gaps** | Enough evidence → **0** critical_gaps. |
| **Hypotheses** | Model often outputs at least one hypothesis with **evidence_against** when the story is clear. |
| **Evidence depth** | Brief has **evidence_strength** with themes and **supporting_refs** → 5 points. |

If the score is **below 90**, check:

- At least one link marked **Primary** (and/or **Official source**).
- At least 2 saved links so the brief can cite multiple refs per event.
- **Rebuild** the brief after adding or marking sources.

## Quick checklist (for the test)

- [ ] Case created with title + objective.
- [ ] One query added and run (Voyager 1 launch).
- [ ] 2–3 links saved from NASA / BBC / Reuters (or similar).
- [ ] At least one link marked **Primary** (and optionally **Official source**).
- [ ] Brief **built** (Case Briefs → Build).
- [ ] Instrument Panel shows **Score ≥ 90** and **Grade A**.

This is your **full test**: one simple case, run through the system, get an A on the instrument panel.
